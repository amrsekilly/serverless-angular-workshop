# Adding Authentication with Auth0

One of my favorite processes to delegate is authentication. With Auth0 not only will we be able to setup a login process that let's us use third-party authentication (e.g. GitHub, Google, etc.) but we can also manage users in there. There is actually a _ton_ more that we could do with Auth0 but that's all we'll need for the task at hand today.

In this section we'll do a few things together:

- setup Auth0 account
- create a new application
- get needed keys

We'll discuss the code needed to pull Auth0 into the project. Then you'll use your lovely thinking machine to complete the excercise to create a login, sign up, and logout process for users. Auth0 has a really easy way of gating pages so we're going to throw that in there too. This means that we'll make sure people are logged in before they're allowed to see the 'Account' page.

Let's go together.

## Get all the Auth0 things!

Auth0 allows us to create a free account so we can poke around. So let's head to [https://auth0.com/](https://auth0.com/) and get setup.

### Creating a New Application

### Grab the keys, let's go!

## Let there be login!

We can add a login button to the navigation so it's up there always available for users
