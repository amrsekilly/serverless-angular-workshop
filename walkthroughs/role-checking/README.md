# Checking Roles with Auth0

Setting roles allows us to gate content, handle privlidges, and more. Today we'll just take a little peak into this power by clicking a button to make sure a user had an 'admin' role, and if so, allowing them to see a super secret information (ok, ok, it's just a `<div>` that has some radio buttons BUT it's the skill gaining that counts). We'll create and set the roles in the UI and also look into the API process of coding in role edits.

Per usual, we'll discuss the ins and outs together, have a code alone excercise section, then come back together to code it all out and answer any questions.

## You and I head to the UI

As we saw before the Auth0 is packed with lots of settings that we're just skimming the surface of. Let's head into the 'User Management > Roles' section and create a few roles.
